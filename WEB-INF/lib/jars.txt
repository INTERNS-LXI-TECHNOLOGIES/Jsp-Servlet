1. servlet-api.jar
 - server specific, so tomcat/lib must contain servlet-api.jar, else tomcat wont run. 
   (So, no need to put another servlet-api.jar in webinf/lib....although while compiling 'where to put jar' doesn't matter, compiler just needs the jar wherever it is)
 - needed for compiling, so set in classpath
2. log4j
 - log4j-api.jar needed for compiling, so set in classpath
 - log4j-api.jar class log4j-core.jar at runtime, so both must be in same location
 - log4j-core.jar needed at runtime only(called by log4j-api.jar), so no need to set in classpath
 - both are application specific, so can be put either in tomcat/lib or webinf/lib. Will be automatically called
4. mysql
 - mysql-connecot.jar needed at runtime only, so no need to set in classpath
 - application specific, so can be put either in tomcat/lib or webinf/lib. Will be automatically called
5. jstl
 - jstl.jar needed at runtime only, so no need to set in classpath
 - application specific, so can be put either in tomcat/lib or webinf/lib. Will be automatically called
